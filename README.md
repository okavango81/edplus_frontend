# Edplus Front-end

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.4.

## Project description

This project consists of a static template developed in Angular, which will serve as the basis for future integration with a Restful API built in Sprig and a MySQL database. The objective here is to create an initial structure that facilitates the implementation of front-end functionalities, ensuring efficient integration with the back-end and the database.


## Objectives

- Front-end (Angular): Develop a static interface that can be easily adapted to consume data from a Restful API
- Back-end (Spring): Future implementation of a Restful API to manage requests and interactions with the database
- Banco de dados (MySQL): Store and manage data efficiently by integrating with the Spring API


## Project structure

- Front-end: Developed in Angular, containing pre-configured components, services and routes
- Back-end: To be developed in Spring, following good Restful API development practices
- Database: MySQL, with a database schema to be defined during integration
